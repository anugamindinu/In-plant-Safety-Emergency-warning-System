# In-plant-Safety-Emergency-warning-System

# Main Research Problem
The existing emergency alarm systems of large-scale enterprises cannot provide the precise location, effective response coordination, and proactive accident prevention. These deficiencies lead to delays in rescue efforts, increased risks during workplace emergencies, and inability to foresee and mitigate potential hazards.

# Solution Overview
The proposed solution is a user-friendly, IoT-based emergency response system that will provide real-time location data, enable rapid incident acknowledgment via RFID, use advanced technologies like image processing to assess the severity of the emergency and guide the appropriate response, and analyze log details to give future predictions to prevent hazards.
